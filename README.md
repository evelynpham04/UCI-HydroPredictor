# UCI-HydroPredictor
Hydrologic Prediction with ML Optimization Code from my Machine Learning Internship at UC Irvine's CHRS, focusing on water resource management. This project optimized data pipelines (40% faster), improved UNet model accuracy (15%), and enhanced satellite image classification (35%), advancing hydrologic prediction accuracy.
